# GMLocalize
Extract text strings from Game Maker code for localization.

Right now it's functional, but not perfect, and it only works for GMS1. Next time I'm bored in class I'll make it work for GMS2 and see about fixing some of the holes in it.

Also, it should probably be re-combined with [GameMakerOrphanedFiles](https://github.com/DragoniteSpam/GameMakerOrphanedFiles) eventually, because it uses most of its code except for the main/helper methods.

I should probably give this a proper readme at some point in the future but this is a way more specialized tool than GMOF so I'm not thinking many other people are going to use it for a while. If you have any questions bother me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DragoniteSpam) or something.
