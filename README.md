# GameMakerOrphanedFiles
Sometimes when you're working on Game Maker projects, you stop using scripts or sprites or objects but don't delete them. This leads to bloated projects, and can make it hard to find the assets that you *do* need. This will hopefully make it easier to detect those assets, so that you can decide if you want to delete them.

Note: I'm currently writing this for Game Maker Studio 1. If I ever finish this and there's demand for it, or if I get bored enough, I'll make a version for Game Maker Studio 2, also.
